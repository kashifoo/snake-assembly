snake-assembly
==============

The "snake" game in IA-32 assembly language. I made it as the course project for my course in assembly language programming.


Running the program
-------------------

A compiled executable (snake.exe) is available for download. Tested on Windows 7 and Windows XP.

Move the snake using the arrow keys.

The game provides the following speed levels:

* Earthworm (very slow)
* Centipede (still too slow - but okay for wimps)
* Cobra (makes for interesting gameplay)
* Black Mamba (be careful - this is the fastest snake ever discovered)

For added challenge, players can select a level:

* None (open playing field)
* Box (the playing field is surrounded by walls)
* Rooms (the snake operates in a space of four rooms)


Information on compiling the code
---------------------------------

snake.asm contains the code for the game. It is dependent on Irvine32.inc which is not provided in this repository.
